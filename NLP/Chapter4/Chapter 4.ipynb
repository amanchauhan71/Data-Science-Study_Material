    "# What's spaCy?\n",
    "\n",
    "SpaCy is **free**, **open-source library** for advanced **Natural language processing**(NLP) in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose you're working with a lot of text, you'll eventually want to know more about it. For example, what's it about? What does the words mean in the context? Who is doing what to whom? What products and compnaies are mentioned in the text? Which texts are simmilar to each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "spaCy is designed specifically for **production use** and helps you build applications that process and \"understand\" large volume of text. It can be used to build **information extarction** or **natural language processing** systems, or to pre-process text for **deep learning**.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## What spaCy isn't?\n",
    "\n",
    "- First, **spaCy** isn't a platform or an \"API\". Unlike a platform, spaCy doesn't provide a software as a service or a web application. It’s an open-source library designed to help you build NLP applications, not a consumable service.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Second, **spaCy is not an out-of-the-box chat bot engine.** While spaCy can be used to power conversational applications, it’s not designed specifically for chat bots, and only provides the underlying text processing capabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Third, **spaCy is not research software.** It’s built on the latest research, but it’s designed to get things done. This leads to fairly different design decisions than NLTK or CoreNLP, which were created as platforms for teaching and research. The main difference is that spaCy is integrated and opinionated. spaCy tries to avoid asking the user to choose between multiple algorithms that deliver equivalent functionality. Keeping the menu small lets spaCy deliver generally better performance and developer experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Fourth, **spaCy is not a company** It’s an open-source library.The company publishing spaCy and other software is called Explosion AI.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Installation\n",
    "\n",
    "spaCy is compatible with **64bit of Cython 2.7/3.5+** and runs on **Unix/Linux**, **macOS/OS X** and **Windows**. The latest version of spaCy is available over pip and conda.\n",
    "\n",
    " --> Installation with pip in Linux,Windows and macOs/OS X for both version of Python 2.7/3.5+\n",
    " \n",
    "     pip install -U spacy or pip install spacy\n",
    "     \n",
    " --> Installation with conda in Linux,Windows and macOs/OS X for both version of Python 2.7/3.5+\n",
    " \n",
    "     conda install -c conda-forge spacy\n",
    "\n",
    "## Features\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, you'll come across mentions of spaCy's features and capabilities. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Statistical models\n",
    "\n",
    "Some of spaCy's features works independently, other requires statistical models to be loaded, which enable spaCy to **predict**\n",
    "linguistic annotations-For example, whether a word is a verb or noun. spaCy currently offers statistical models for a variety of languages, which can be installed as individual Python modules. Models can differ in size, speed, memory usage, accuracy, and the data they include. The model you choose always depends upon your use cases and the texts you're working with. For a general use case, the small and the default models are always a good start. They typically include the following components:\n",
    "\n",
    "  - **Binary weights** for the part-of-speech tagger, dependency parser and named entity recognizer to predict those    annotations in context.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  - **Lexical entries** in the vocabulary, i.e. words and their context-independent attributes like the shape or spelling.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  - **Data files** like lemmatization rules and lookup tables.\n",
    "  - **Word vectors**,  i.e. multi-dimensional meaning representations of words that let you determine how similar they are to each other.\n",
    "  - **Configuration** options, like the language and processing pipeline settings, to put spaCy in the correct state when you load in the model.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  \n",
    "### Linguistic annotations\n",
    "\n",
    "spaCy provides a variety of linguistic annotations to give you **insights into a text’s grammatical structure.** This includes the word types, like the parts of speech, and how the words are related to each other. For example, if you’re analyzing text, it makes a huge difference whether a noun is the subject of a sentence, or the object – or whether “google” is used as a verb, or refers to the website or company in a specific context.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you’ve [downloaded and installed](https://spacy.io/usage/models) a model, you can load it via spacy.load() This will return a *Language* object containing all components and data needed to process text. We usually call it *nlp* object on a string of text will return a processed *Doc* :"

This way, you’ll never lose any information when processing text with spaCy.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Tokenization\n",
    "\n",
    "During processing, spaCy first tokenizes the text, i.e. segments it into words, punctuation and so on. This is done by applying rules specific to each language. For example, punctuation at the end of a sentence should be split off – whereas “U.K.” should remain one token.  Each *Doc* consists of individual tokens, and we can iterate over them:"

    "\n",
    "First, the raw text is split on whitespace characters, similar to text.split(' '). Then, the tokenizer processes the text from left to right. On each substring, it performs two checks:\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Does the substring match a tokenizer exception rule?**  For example, “don’t” does not contain whitespace, but should be split into two tokens, “do” and “n’t”, while “U.K.” should always remain one token. \n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Can a prefix, suffix or infix be split off?** For example punctuation like commas, periods, hyphens or quotes.\n",
    "\n",
    "If there’s a match, the rule is applied and the tokenizer continues its loop, starting with the newly split substrings. This way, spaCy can split **complex, nested tokens** like combinations of abbreviations and multiple punctuation marks.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\".\\Images\\17.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "While punctuation rules are usually pretty general, tokenizer exceptions strongly depend on the specifics of the individual language. This is why each available language has its own subclass like *English* or *German*, that loads in lists of hard-coded data and exception rules.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Part-of-speech(pos) tags and dependencies\n",
    "\n",
    "After tokenization, spaCy can parse and tag a given *Doc*. This is where the statistical model comes in, which enables spaCy to make a prediction of which tag or label most likely applies in this context. A model consists of binary data and is produced by showing a system enough examples for it to make predictions that generalize across the language – for example, a word following “the” in English is most likely a noun.\n",
    "\n",
    "Linguistic annotations are available as **Token** .Like many NLP libraries, spaCy encodes all strings to hash values to reduce memory usage and improve efficiency. So to get the readable string representation of an attribute, we need to add an underscore _ to its name:"

    "## Serialization\n",
    "\n",
    "If you’ve been modifying the pipeline, vocabulary, vectors and entities, or made updates to the model, you’ll eventually want to **save your progress** – for example, everything that’s in your *nlp* object. This means you’ll have to translate its contents and structure into a format that can be saved, like a file or a byte string. This process is called **<u>serialization</u>**. spaCy comes with **built-in serialization** methods and supports the Pickle protocol.\n",
    "\n",
    "All container classes, i.e. Language (nlp), Doc, Vocab and StringStore have the following methods available:\n",

    "## Training\n",
    "\n",
    "spaCy’s models are statistical and every “decision” they make – for example, which part-of-speech tag to assign, or whether a word is a named entity – is a prediction. This prediction is based on the examples the model has seen during training. To train a model, you first need training data – examples of text, and the labels you want the model to predict. This could be a part-of-speech tag, a named entity or any other information.\n",
    "\n",
    "The model is then shown the unlabelled text and will make a prediction. Because we know the correct answer, we can give the model feedback on its prediction in the form of an **error gradient** of the **loss function** that calculates the difference between the training example and the expected output. The greater the difference, the more significant the gradient and the updates to our model.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\".\\Images\\22.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "When a training model, we don't want to memorize our examples- we want it to come up with theory that can be generalized with other examples. After all we don't just want the model to learn that this one instance of \"Amazon\" right here is a company - we want it to learn that \"Amazon\", in contexts like this, is most likely the company. That's why the training data should be representative always be the source of the data we want to process. A model is trained on wikipedia, where the sentences in the first person is to rare, will likely perform badly on Twitter.Similarly, model trained on romantic novels will likely perform bad in legal text.\n",
    "\n",
    "This also means that in order to know how the model is performing, and whether its learning the right things, you don't only need of training data- you'll also need evaluation data aswell. If you only test those data from which you trained, you will have no idea how well it's generalizing. If you want to train the model from scratch, you usually need at least 200 of images for training and evaluation. To update the existing model, you can achieve decent results with very few examples - as long as they're representative.\n",

    "\n",
    "## Language Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Every language is different from each other and usually full of exceptions and special cases, especially the amongst the most common words. Some of these are shared across languages, while others are entirely specific - usually it's to specific that they need to be hard-coded. The language module contains all the language-specific data, organized in simple Python files. This makes the data easy to update and extend.\n",
    "\n",
    "The shared language data in the directory root includes rules that can be generalized across languages – for example, rules for basic punctuation, emoji, emoticons, single-letter abbreviations and norms for equivalent tokens with different spellings, like \" and ”. This helps the models make more accurate predictions. The individual language data in a submodule contains rules that are only relevant to a particular language. It also takes care of putting together all components and creating the Language subclass – for example, English or German.\n",
